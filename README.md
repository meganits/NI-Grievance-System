# Gunaso API - D0 Kickoff Plan

# Current Status and Learning Path
I am starting this project with strong JavaScript and Node.js skills. I am new to NestJS. My first goal is to learn NestJS basics quickly while I set up the project.

# Proposed System Architecture
- Framework: NestJS
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma
- Authentication: JWT
- Main Modules: Auth, Users, Tickets, Categories, Wards, Comments.
- Main Challenge: Setting up access control for different user roles.

# Next Steps (D1 - Schema and Contracts)
- Write the Prisma schema file for the database.
- Create the first database migration.
- Set up the basic NestJS project and modules.
- Create DTO classes for API requests and responses.

# Risks and How I Will Manage Them
- Risk: Learning NestJS quickly.
  - Plan: I will focus on learning key parts first: Modules, Controllers, Services, Pipes, and Guards.
- Risk: Setting up user roles and permissions.
  - Plan: I will start with simple login and then add role checking step by step.
